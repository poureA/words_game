word game

john and sarah, who were tired of the difference game, started the game.

The word game is that john gives strings to sarah and sarah must give john the good words along with the number of repetitions.

In fact, john gives sarah a string whose words are separated by whitespace characters. For example, if the input text Hello SAliB! Be, its words Hello and SAliB! are.

According to john, any character other than English letters is a bad letter and should be removed. For example, the characters A and b are good letters and characters! They are bad words.

We also call a word bad if it has half of its characters. sarah should remove the bad characters for each good word and then capitalize the first character of each word and lower the other characters. For example, the word A! It's bad but A!A is good.
Finally, sarah should be returned in the form of a dictionary whose keys are text words and the values of each key are the number of repetitions of that word in the final text.
